# matching-pursuit

This is a hybrid numpy-tensorflow implementation of a matching pursuit algorithm for sparse coding of auditory signals.
It is not particularly optimized. The goal is to reproduce the findings of Smith and Lewicki http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v439/n7079/abs/nature04485.html
